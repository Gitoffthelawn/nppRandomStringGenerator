# nppGeneratePasswords
A plugin for the popular Notepad++ Editor. This plugin will generate any number of random passwords/strings to a  new document, or to an existing document (think datafile)

# Currently in progress
Trying to massively increase generation speeds. With the current develop branch multithreading is being used to generate (and display) 1.000.000 strings with 32 length in 4.8 seconds.
The current release (v1.7.2) can't even think of those numbers.
